<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
<h2>My name is: Rue Hyder </h2>
<h3>The day I had the most fun:</h3>
<p>Was the day I got bruce, my first puppy!</p>
<p>He was a black german shepard. He had a white birthmark on his left and it was adorable
!We went out for a walk and played in the lake nearby. We played fetch and he learned how to sit.</p>
<p>We played and played, and the best part was when he fell asleep in my arms! That was my favorite part!</p>
<h3>To be continued...</h3>
